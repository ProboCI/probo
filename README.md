Probo
===========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ProboCI/probo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ProboCI/probo) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/ProboCI/probo/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/ProboCI/probo?branch=master)

[Probo.ci](http://probo.ci) is an open source continuous integration and quality assurance tool
that lets you build branches and pull requests inside docker containers,
reports back on the progress of each step, and then *keeps the environment
around* and gives you a link so that you can go and preview the work in a
shared space.

Probo has a [Service Oriented Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture) so to
get the full picture have a look at all of the projects in the [Probo Organization](https://github.com/ProboCI).
This project currently contains the Container Manager (which provides a high level interface to docker) and
the Github Handler (responsible for receiving data from and sending data to github). In the long term these
services will be factored out into their own projects and this project will be a packaging project making it
easy to install compatible versions of all of the individual services.

## Quickstart

See the [Quickstart](QUICKSTART.md) guide for how to get up and running with your own instance of Probo

## Compatibility
The code uses generators and requires node `io.js` or `node` 4.x+.

### Node Version
Several of Probo's microservices are currently on different Node versions as we update to newer Node versions, so the Node Verson Manager, [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), is installed to switch between different versions of Node prior to running `npm install`.

**Current Node Version:** Node 4.x (Current default Node version)

Run the following commands in the `probo` installation directory to update the node_modules for probo.

    nvm use default
    npm install

## Error Codes
Errors are thrown when a build cannot be found however there are man reasons a
build may not be found. These include:
 - Build has been reaped
 - Build is currently still building
 - Build id is invalid or does not exist

We return a 404 when a build cannot be found. However for the sake of
integration with other services, the error response will be a JSON object
with an errorCode:
 - 410R: Build reaped
 - 423P: Build in progress
 - 400I: Build id invalid
 - 404N: Build id not found
