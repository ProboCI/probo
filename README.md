Probo
===========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ProboCI/probo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ProboCI/probo)

Probo is an open source continuous integration and quality assurance tool
that lets you build branches and pull requests inside docker containers,
reports back on the progress of each step, and then *keeps the environment
around* and gives you a link so that you can go and preview the work in a
shared space.

## Compatability
The code uses generators and requires node 0.11.x or greater, with the --harmony-generators or --harmony flags, or any version of io.js
